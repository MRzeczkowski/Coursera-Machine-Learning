# Coursera-Machine-Learning
Completed exercises from the free Coursera Machine Learning course. Used Ocatve-4.2.1, from what I understand it has the same 
syntax as Mathlab so it should also work fine with Mathlab or at least with fiew changes. Every solution is 100% correct and most 
of the code is vectorized so it works pretty fast.
